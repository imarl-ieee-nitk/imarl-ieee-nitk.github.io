[**Interactive Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**](https://github.com/imarl-ieee-nitk) is a year-long project taken up by a group of members at [**IEEE-NITK**](https://github.com/IEEE-NITK). In this project, we aim to develop and improve multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms that enable interactive, collaborative, and negotiating behaviors in the mixed cooperative-competitive multi-player games (like [Sequential Social Dilemmas](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03037), [particle](https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs), and [MAgent](https://github.com/PettingZoo-Team/MAgent) environments).

This blog will be used to share articles on various topics in single and multi-agent reinforcement learning.
