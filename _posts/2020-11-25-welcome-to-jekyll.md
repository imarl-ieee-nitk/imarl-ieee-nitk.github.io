This is a sample markdown file for the blog posts to be submitted. You’ll find this post in your `/_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new blog post files, fork this repository and add a file named `YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-the-post.md` in the `/_posts` directory. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works. Resolve conflicts, if any and make a pull request.

Use double asterisk for **bold** and single asterisk for *italics*.

To use MathJax for LaTeX MATH, simply add $e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0$ for inline math and 

$$ e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0 $$ 

for a block display.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

You can also use this for a python code block:

```python
def function(args):
  print('HELLO WORLD\n')

function()
```

Put all your images in the `/assets` directory. Use the following format for display:

`![Jekyll (alt text)](/assets/jekyll.png)`

![Jekyll (alt text)](/assets/jekyll.png)
